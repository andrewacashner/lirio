# lirio: Lilypond Extensions for Academic Critical Editions

Andrew Cashner, `andrew@andrewcashner.com`

- Extensions to the Lilypond music-typesetting system, like LaTeX packages,
  for common needs of music editors, especially for pre-1800 European and
      Euro-colonial music
- Semantic, configurable, no-fuss markup for preparatory (incipit) staves,
  mensural coloration brackets, section headings, custom fonts, etc.
- Used for two critical editions of music from 17th-century Mexico and Spain:
    - *Villancicos about Music from Seventeenth-Century Spain and New Spain*, vol. 1, 
    [Web Library of Seventeenth-Century Music no. 32](https://www.sscm-wlscm.org/main-catalogue/browse-by-composer/406-villancicos-about-music-from-seventeenth-century-spain-and-new-spain-1)
    - *Villancicos about Music from Seventeenth-Century Spain and New Spain*, vol. 2, 
    [Web Library of Seventeenth-Century Music no.  36](https://www.sscm-wlscm.org/main-catalogue/browse-by-composer/449-villancicos-about-music-from-seventeenth-century-spain-and-new-spain-volume-2)
- See my article, "Lilypond Notation Software in the
  Digital-Humanities Toolbox," forthcoming 2024 in *Digital Humanities
  Quarterly* 
- A document strictly prepared using this system can be converted to
  [MEI-XML](https://music-encoding.org/) using my
  [`ly2mei`](https://github.com/andrewacashner/ly2mei) tool
